# PreSemester Python Learning

This repository contains Python exercises and programs for pre-semester refreshment learning.

All material is based off of that found in the published book by Charles Severance called "Python For Everybody, Exploring Data in Python 3." This book is stated to be designed to teach people to program even if they have no prior experience. This book states that it can be used to teach programming to anyone.

I am utilizing this book to prepare me for my next level college course in Programming. I had no prior experience in Python.

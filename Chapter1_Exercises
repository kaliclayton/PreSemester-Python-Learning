#What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer? - Store information for the long term, even beyond a power cycle
#What is a program? - A program is a set of instructions that specifies a computation
#What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter? - A compiler translates a program written in a high level language into a low level language all at once, in preparation for later execution, 
    #and an interpreter executes a program in a high level language by translating it one line at a time.
#Which of the following contains "machine code"? - The Python Interpreter
#The error with the code in this question is that "print" is misspelled as "primt".
#Where in the computer is a variable such as "x" stored after the following Python line finishes? - Main Memory
#What will the following program print out:
x=43
x=x+1
print(x)
    #44
#Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability:
    #1 Central Processing Unit: Human's ability to use a hand and pencil to write a story based on an internal mental idea and a strategic outline formulated by oneself.
    #2 Main Memory: A human's short term memory span.
    #3 Secondary Memory: A human's long term memory span.
    #4 Input device: A human's 5 senses which gather input from the external environment.
    #5 Output device: A human's ability to speak and conduct movement with one's body to engage in environment.
#How do you fix a "Syntax Error"? To fix a syntax error which is a violation of the "grammar" rules of Python, simply go back line by line and re-read the code to check whether it says precisely what it is meant to.
